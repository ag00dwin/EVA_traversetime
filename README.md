# EVA_traversetime

## Context
Meili-I was the first analogue  mission by [Space Health Research](https://spacehealthresearch.com/). (SHR) and represents the UKâ€™s first high-fidelity analogue astronaut crewed mission. The Geological Surveys of Impact Regions (GSIR) study of Meili-I facilitated the testing of important logistical considerations for planetary exploration completed during Extravehicular Activity (EVA). 

This repository stores Python code used to process GPS tracks collected using the smartphone application [Avenza](https://www.avenza.com/avenza-maps/).

## Installation 
No installation is required. Scripts are short and designed to be adapted and applied to various problems. Python scripts can be downloaded from this repository and intergrated into pre-existing scripts where such functionality is required.

## Python Scripts

**_activity stop modelling.py** 
Uses a traverse speed threshold and cluster anlalysis in XYtime to locate within the GPS tracks when breaks were taken. Calculates a historgram of the length of time of each break.

**_traverse walkspeed-slope modelling.py** 
Calculates relative slope and absolate slope for intervals of the GPS tracks and plots this as historgram. Fits functions to relative and absolate slope to model walking speed.

**_traverse dijkstra paths.py** 
Runs a path finding algorithm from relative slope walking model (from ``_traverse walkspeed-slope modelling``) and uses this to calculate the most efficent paths from A to B on the island DEM. Outputs the path itself as well as a heatmap for time to reach all accessible grid pixels on the DEM.
